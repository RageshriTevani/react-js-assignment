Explain Life cycle in Class Component and functional component with Hooks
<!-- 
=> Class Components Lifecycle:

In a React Class Component, lifecycle methods can be used to hook into different stages of a component's existence. 

Here are the key lifecycle methods:

1.Mounting: 
When an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM.

constructor(): Called before the component is mounted.
static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state): Invoked right before calling render().
componentDidMount(): Invoked immediately after a component is mounted.

2.Updating: 
When the component's props or state change.

static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state): Called when the component is receiving new props.
shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState): Determines if the component should re-render.
render(): Renders the component.
getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState): Called right before the most recently rendered output is committed to the DOM.
componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot): Called after the component is updated in the DOM.

3.Unmounting: 
When a component is being removed from the DOM.

componentWillUnmount(): Called right before the component is unmounted and destroyed.

4.Error Handling: 
When there is an error during rendering, in a lifecycle method, or in the constructor of any child component.

static getDerivedStateFromError(error): Invoked after an error has been thrown by a descendant component.
componentDidCatch(error, info): Called after an error has been thrown by a descendant component.


=> Functional Components with Hooks
Functional components, with the introduction of Hooks in React 16.8, can achieve similar lifecycle management. Key hooks include:

1. Mounting and Updating:

useState(): Used to manage state within a functional component.

useEffect(() => { ... }): Runs after the component renders. Can be used for side effects. By default, it runs after every render.

To mimic componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate: 
useEffect(() => {
  // Component did mount and did update
});

To mimic componentDidMount (run once):
useEffect(() => {
  // Component did mount
}, []);

To mimic componentDidUpdate for specific dependencies:
useEffect(() => {
  // Component did update
}, [dependency]);

2.Unmounting:
useEffect(() => { ... return () => { ... }; }, []);: The return function within useEffect runs during the unmount phase.
useEffect(() => {
    return () => {
    // Component will unmount
};
}, []);

3.Error Handling: 
There is no direct hook for error handling like componentDidCatch. Error boundaries must still be implemented using class components.

4.Optimization:
useMemo(): Memoizes a value to avoid re-computation on every render.
useCallback(): Memoizes a function to prevent its recreation on every render.
Example Comparison

Class Component:-->
<script>
    class MyComponent extends React.Component {
constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { count: 0 };
}

componentDidMount() {
    console.log("Component did mount");
}

componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {
    console.log("Component did update");
}

componentWillUnmount() {
    console.log("Component will unmount");
}

    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <p>{this.state.count}</p>
                <button onClick={() => this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })}>Increment</button>
        </div>
    );
    }
}
</script>

<!-- Functional Component with Hooks:-->
<script>
    import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

    useEffect(() => {
        console.log("Component did mount or update");
        return () => {
        console.log("Component will unmount");
    };
  }, [count]); // dependency array

return (
    <div>
        <p>{count}</p>
        <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
);
};

</script>
